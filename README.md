** This dataset has been used is the research paper titled ; "Evaluation of Extreme Weather Impacts on Utility-scale Photovoltaic Plant Performance in the United States" by Nicole D. Jacksona, Thushara Gundaa, Sandia National Laboratories.
### About the data:

This dataset contains data of three data types (operations and maintenance tickets, weather data, and production data) that can be used to predict the low performance ratio of utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) plants during extreme weather conditions in the US.

The US is divided into multiple regions by NOAA based on their location. Furthermore, there are 10 zones based on Temperature and 5 zones based on Humidity.

### Target variable:

***Performance Ratio(PR)***, defined by IEC 61724, is quotient of the systemâ€™s final yield to its reference yield. It indicates the overall effect of losses on the system output.

### Terminology:

* NOAA: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
* IEC 61724 is a series of standards that define parameters for monitoring the performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems
* Irradiance is the radiometry term for the power per unit area of electromagnetic radiation incident on a surface. The SI unit for irradiance is watts per square meter [W/m2], or milli watts per square milli metre [mW/mm2].

### Libraries used:
* Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
* NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
* Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.
* Plotly Express is a dynamic, consistent, high-level API for creating figures.
* Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python, which builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures.
* Scikit Learn is a simple and efficient tool for predictive data analysis, accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts,it builds on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
